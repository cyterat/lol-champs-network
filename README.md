# ðŸŽ® League of Legends Champions and Classes Network Visualization

[League of Legends Champions Network](https://lol-champion-builds-d6r5z.ondigitalocean.app/)

An interactive web-based tool for visualizing relationships between League of Legends champions. This visualization, powered by vis.js, represents champions as nodes. 

Clicking on a champion node reveals a dynamic popup with links to various external build guides.

## ðŸ’Ž User Features

<table><tr><td><b>Champion Builds</b><br>Click on any node to open a pop-up panel with dynamically generated links to popular build sites, providing builds for the selected champion.</td><td><img width='700' src="./readme/lol-champs-network-s2.png"></td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td><b>Click/Hover Effects</b><br>Edges highlight with different colors when you click/hover over them providing additional information.</td><td><img src="./readme/lol-champs-network-s3.png"></td><td><img src="./readme/lol-champs-network-s1.png"></td></tr></table>

## ðŸ”¨ Technical Implementation

### Performance Optimizations:

- Progressive Image Loading: Images load in small batches to prevent freezing during startup
- Fallback Images: Automatic fallback to default images when champion portraits fail to load
- Batch Processing: Loads images in groups of 5 with small delays between batches

## Hosting

The graph visualization is hosted on Digital Ocean.

## Motivation

This project was created for fun to visualize the distributions and relationships between different entities in League of Legends.

## ðŸ’¡ Important Notice - 2025 Rework

- The first version of the project was built using python NetworkX and PyVis libraries. It had extremely poor performance and messed up html and javascript, as it was 'generated' through python libraries. That's why I decided to completely rework it, using cleaner approach and app structure, i.e. HTML/CSS/Javascript only.

- The entire "data" side of project was done by me using Python (requests, BeautifulSoup) for scraping, cleansing, aggregation, and conversion to the appropriate format. Currenlty it still sits in the Jupyter Notebook, waiting to be refactored into a separate script that will potentially have a scheduled run.

- 99% of the JavasScript code has been generated through prompts by Gemini > Claude > Chat GPT (in that order), with 1% of minor tweaks from my side. 

- I had been trying to set up Mobalytics widget with champion builds, on node select, for a long time. However due to unresolved CORS errors related to dynamically generated elements, I decided to abandon the idea and instead switched to a source agnostic solution. This is currenlty a dynamically generated (tied to a specific champion) list of various build sites, allowing users to choose the source they prefer.

## To Do

- âœ… ~~Python generated visualization will be replaced with html/js/css trio.~~ 
- âœ… ~~Champion builds widget/tooltip added/~~
- Scheduled script written in Python, for data manipulations, will be implemented.
